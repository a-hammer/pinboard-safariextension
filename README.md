# Pinboard Safari Extension

![Screenshot Pinboard Safari extension](screenshot.png)

Super simple Safari extension for bookmarking the current page in [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in). Click the button and done.

## Installing

Open `pinboard.safariextz`. Existing tabs need to be reloaded before using the extension.

**Note**: With the changes to extensions in Safari 9 on El Capitan, Safari might complain when trying to install this. It will probably be fine though.

## Usage

Click the button to open Pinboard's default add bookmark page. The current selection is set to the bookmark's description (optional).
